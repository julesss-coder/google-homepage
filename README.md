HTML/CSS project #1 - The Odin Project

Task: To reproduce the Google.com homepage by using HTML and CSS. (I built the German version of the homepage.)

Skills I demonstrated by completing this project:

- Making navbars, styling and positioning them:
  1. For the top navbar, I used an unordered list and set it to "display: inline".
  2. For the two bottom navbars, I used two sets of <span> that contain the links and used "float" to position them left and right, respectively. 
- Making search forms and submit buttons, styling and positioning them.
- Strategically commenting out parts of my code to find errors and enjoying the process of problem-solving, instead of giving in to despair and deciding that coding sucks...
- Inspecting the source code of the page I reproduced and adapting my code accordingly.

While working on this project, I also worked through the book "A smarter way to learn HTML & CSS" by Mark Myers which was really helpful in understanding and applying the basics.
